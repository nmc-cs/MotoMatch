* DESCRIPTION:
    * Helps an individual find the right motorcycle based on given criteria. User will be faced with a one page web application that will display questions.
    * To achieve this we will need a strong database of all motorcycle brands and their bikes. To maybe simplify we can start off with just sport bikes and all their features. Once the user is done selecting their criteria the Ui should display a specified few options in a detailed 3d image fitting the description of the users criteria.
